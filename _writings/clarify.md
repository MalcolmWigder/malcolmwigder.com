  <h1>Clarifying my positions</h1>

  <p>It’s time I clarify my positions on a few things. In my life I have been many things, and not in a normal way. I have gone on month long stretches of spotty memory, unexplainable decisions, and confusion. However, I have also had stretches of months where I feel tranquility, understanding, and a sense of destiny in the world. I believe I have finally integrated the two sides, and thought I should document this clarity I have, and explain where I stand on things.
</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <div class="item-title">Belief</div>
      <p>Belief is the most powerful tool we have. Belief is how you form the reality around you. If you truly believe you are flying, you might as well be flying. Let us classify three types of beliefs: those which are based in the inherent idea of objective reality, those which are arising from subjective experience, and those beliefs which come from nothing.<p>

      <p>The first are those we know and love. To say that there are atoms in the world is a kind of religious belief. Atoms and other particles you don’t directly experience are a great predictive system developed by scientists. To believe in atoms means you must believe 1) there is an objective reality, or something outside of your own experience 2) there is some logic to this reality 3) many other dependent factors which I am honestly incapable of listing. <p>

    <p>That being said, there is nothing harmful about believing in atoms. It is a useful system, but we need not believe in it. Still, I find that maintaining beliefs based in objective reality is crucial for a healthy life, and interacting with other people. 
    <p>“I think Trump is evil!” <p>
    <p>“Well, that requires you to believe in Trump, or the concept of evil, when you could just not.” Conversations like the above aren’t far off from where I was a few months ago, but people tend to look at you like you’re crazy. People tend to believe that believing in objective reality and thus caring about other people is an essential part of being human. I would have to agree, but choosing that belief is much more complicated than just taking it for granted (more on this later).<p>
    <p>There are, of course, more harmful objective-reality-based beliefs. One of these is prejudice, or the belief that some people are lesser than you. Beliefs like these have a strong correlation with causing suffering to other people, so we can deem them harmful. In order to believe them, you have to first believe in other people, and race, and these kinds of things.<p>
    <p>It is apparent most people do not choose their beliefs, or know they believe them. The world is spherical: no belief, pure rational knowledge. And yes! This is a great belief, I share it too, but have you ever perceived the curvature of the Earth yourself? No. To you, it appears flat. <p>
    <p>I also find that many people start from a few root beliefs, and then grow dependent beliefs in an intertwining and contradictory manner. It is beautiful, really. You ask someone enough questions and you can see just how woven and intricate our ideas of reality are.

    <p>The second are those which arise from subjective experience. Note that I say “arise” not “come from.” If you really focus, you can feel these beliefs bubbling up from the surface. I guess I’m talking about the act of “noticing something.”<p>
    <p>The belief that I am in a room right now comes from the idea that I had an experience once which I called “a room”, and this is just like that. The walls, the roof, all of it. These are also essential, and largely non-controversial. But they are still beliefs, still choices. If I feel anxious, I may decide that I am anxious, yet another belief. However, if I focus on the anxiety, it is really just a feeling. Meanwhile, the experience of the walls and roof are just that, there is no room. <p>

    <p>The last type of belief are those which are based on no reality to speak of. They can be extremely powerful. “I believe I will succeed” might be one. You may have put together a complicated way to prove you will succeed, but that is many beliefs strung together for a result. True self belief is just that: a dumb feeling coming from nothing but the will to believe it.<p>

	<p>I find that in order to generate these beliefs, you must first deconceptualize everything which makes the belief impossible. The idea that I am flying right now, or capable of flying, contradicts a lot of physics and rationality. So release beliefs of physics and rationality: they will be there when you need them. <p>
	<p>The hardest thing to wrap my head around was logic. What is beyond logic? I am using logic now to communicate these ideas, in fact, ideas themself require a sense of inherent logic. The thing is: once you let go of logic, there’s nothing left except the choice to return. And I did come back, after a while. It's not so bad to float in a void of thoughtlessness, drifting from experience to experience, but you come back. You have to. Why?<p>
</p>
    

    <li>
      <div class="item-title">Compassion</div>
      <p>If you met me, you may not think it to be such a core tenant of my life, but compassion is the driving force in everything I do. You may not think it because I have been horrible and mean before, but true compassion is believing that it was I who did those horrible things. I who must live with them, and grow as a result. I could easily say it was a different person, but it wasn’t. <p>
	<p>What is the price of freedom? Everything. You lose logic and you have nothing left. You have no family or friends or loved ones. You just have ideas and memories that you can choose to enter. But you will be walled off from a crucial part of human existence, which is the lack of freedom. To feel in love and heartbroken is exactly what we live for, and forgetting that is exactly how we do it.<p>
	<p>And when you come back to the world it's not infatuation. It's a mature kind of love. Me and the world argue sometimes, but I know it’ll always be me and it. We don’t lose ourselves in love every day, which might be crying to a beautiful song, falling in love, holding your child in your arms, but we choose to love each other. But of course, if you are intentional in this love, then you won’t be swung around like a leaf in the wind; you will instead be an admirer of the wind, who decides to dance with it, even if he gets thrown into a tree.<p>
	<p>This is compassion, and it is the thoughtful choice to love things in or about the world. It may look like helping a friend, or treating a negative thought in your own mind kindly. <p>
	<p>This has been my journey, exiting the world and coming back. It is a strange space that I am in. I see people harmed by their beliefs constantly, and I think to myself how voluntary it is, and yet, how essential. My battle has been this convoluted nonsense. Their’s has been something much more real, to them.<p>

	<p>This choice of compassion, so crucial to life, is the fire within us. The mind is a powerful weapon, but what will you do with it? The fire decides, and it tells me to be a better friend, a better person. <p>
	<p>And how I do this is using everything I’ve learned. The construction of belief is a powerful tool, and I decide to use it for those I care about. Immediately, this is myself and the people immediately around me. Mid-term, this is friends and family. And long-term, this is all of consciousness itself. So here are a few more beliefs which have been good to me.<p>
</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div class="item-title">Creativity</div>
      <p>Repression mechanisms: everywhere I go it's almost all I see. People distracting themselves, people projecting, people hiding. When I find myself doing repression, I try to pull it out like a weed. It is a painful process, similar to taking a clump of hair from your head and ripping it out.<p>
        <p>Jung talked extensively about repression mechanisms, but he was a sick man. It is plainly obvious. If you learn anything about him you know how special his life is, but you also learn how depressed and disturbed he was. He touched something powerful and couldn’t return. I feel that I have returned in a way he never could, despite idolizing him for a while. And so his life became writing about repression mechanisms, one big repression mechanism. <p>

        <p>But he had some remarkable ideas. He explains that the unconscious is a giant sea of ideas within all of us. The same sea, and from it we pull out the same bunch of cultural ideas to explain oneself and his world. Dreams are the unconscious speaking to us, communicating in the language of symbols. <p>
        <p>Joseph Cambell builds off of this in a way, talking about how the Hero’s Journey is the only story ever told, all from the great well of creativity called the unconscious mind.<p>

        <p>So what is creativity? I believe that it is any way you express yourself to the world. There is a crucial balance here, as every time you try this the world will push back. It doesn’t like to be altered, but you must do it, or you will be swallowed up, a big nothing. You cannot reject the world either, else you’re not really being creative. <p>
        <p>This is anything from arranging colors in some way, to directing a movie. I also believe that everyone has one or more built-in forms of creativity.<p>
        <p>So in this way, I don’t believe in a blank slate. I believe that we come in with plenty, actually, including a way we like to express ourselves. For some, this is music, for others, this is math. Personally, I like writing and other outlets, but it isn’t the way my mind chooses to express itself. I like solving puzzles, and the solution to this one will take my whole life. You’ll see, and you’ll enjoy it I’m sure.<p>
	    <p>In those that lack this form of creative expression, I can only find depression. And in the days where I wasn’t producing anything of my own, the same can be said. This might be the only sad thing in the world, someone who never reaches their potential. And potential is one more concept I believe in.<p>
	    <p>I also think creativity is one of the greatest sources of deconceptualizing, or reducing the barriers between you and existence. Art can make people feel pure devastation, happy to be alive, anything. It is an ultimate form of celebration of the world, which is one great way to demonstrate compassion. <p>

	    <p>Before we move on, let’s take stock. <p>
	    <p>We come from the idea that beliefs are choices which may come from sources or not. We choose beliefs which align with our value of compassion, which is the mature and intentional love for things in the world. We pick up a belief in the unconscious, the creative center of all that is. This unconsciousness can drive us to repress our feelings, or be the source of artistic expression. We should aim for artistic expression, as it is a great weapon against bad ideas.<p>

    

    <li>
      <div class="item-title">The State</div>
      <p>So what do I believe politically? What aligns with compassion and creativity? Not the state.<p>
    <p>You may be in fantasy land, where the state is a good actor and they build the roads and make the laws. That’s okay. I was there too.<p>
    <p>I’ll probably write much more about this fantasy, but the point I’m making is that a state is nothing more than a monopoly on violence. It doesn’t just have it, that’s all it is. You might ask who will build the roads, I would say people. People will build the roads. All the state can do is hold them at gunpoint and tell them to do it.<p>
    <p>I’d never wish that fate on anyone. In fact, the most gruesome fates in history have been those committed by states, not individuals. A state, in the capitalist sense, includes large corporations. To many, this may seem obvious: slavery, selling poisonous food, placing dictators in power to exploit foregin resources, even genocide. But to others, this may sound wrong and unfair to our dear state. If you are others, then I’m sorry and surprised you are reading this. You won’t be able to unsee everything you read, and so you will investigate all these beliefs as I once did. You will be confused for a long time.</p>
    <p>You may also be in a different fantasy land, where we need to tear down the government and start over. But that’s no revolution. That's more power, more of the same. <p>

    <p>The true revolution is in your heart, and that’s obvious. What good will you do hiding from the world? Nothing. You need to embrace it, even in its wickedness, and then you will truly be able to help people. Similarly, you cannot blindly accept it for what it is, as the state is a great evil. But creating a new state in its place is not eliminating the state. Eliminating the state happens within yourself. <p>
    <p>Do something illegal, and then there is no state to speak of. But not everyone has the privilege of forgetting, which is why we must use this forgetfulness to help others forget. <p>
    And then the state becomes nothing more than a bunch of angry people with guns. All it ever was.

    <p>I prescribe a personal anarchy where you don’t storm the capitol tomorrow, you think about how you can improve the world in a way that is personal to you, not considering the state. <p>

    <p>To clarify, we are outside the bounds of republican or democrat, and if you believe in those categories that is fine. The system is designed for you to believe in them, even holding your rights captive to make sure you believe. There should be no such thing as rights. Only wrongs. The government isn’t threatening to remove rights, but to do wrongs.
    I believe that resistance looks like rejecting those categories. <p>

    <p>However, in the interest of having compassion, we must come back to the world. We can’t totally reject those categories, else we leave a lot of people behind. So we do what we must to ease suffering. Whatever that looks like for you. For me, it looks like this.<p>
</p>
    

    <li>
      <div class="item-title">Connection</div>
      <p>I can’t pretend it isn’t lonely to feel this way. It definitely is.  <p>
	
	 <p>Let me clarify that I don’t claim to be some mystic. Carl Jung said he simply dipped his hand in a river that was already there. I say he fell in. I say chain me to a rock for all time because the sun is worthless in the dark. Are you getting this? <p>

     <p>So I will be lonely if I must. No alternative to compassion. No alternative to self-awareness. I don’t want to fall in love with anything, I want to rise into awareness, and bring those I care about with me. <p>

</p>
