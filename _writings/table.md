  <h1>My Life In Five Table Tennis Opponents</h1>

<p>The impact table tennis has had on my life cannot be overstated. No, I don’t mean ping pong. I’m not trying to hit the ball on the other side of the table, I’m trying to win. It would be more accurate to ask what my importance is to the game of table tennis; to that I would say, probably very small. Probably infinitesimal in the sea of great players in the world, and yet, I’m honored to have participated in it at all.</p>

<p>Some people play ping pong, and they slap around a plastic ball, and that's fine. But when you meet someone who plays table tennis, you can feel it. This isn’t some challengers bullshit either. You don’t transcend space and time and have a threesome. It's truly about control over the ball, and how you interact with it. When I play, I know where the ball is how I know where my self is, and that feeling is one of the greatest pleasures of my life. You can imagine a little boy splitting his soul in two and dancing with the other half, and that doesn’t really do it justice. So maybe you do transcend space and time (but there haven’t been any threesomes yet). It’s probably like how Federer feels when he plays tennis; I can only wonder. Hopefully it's how you feel about something.</p>

<p>And with all this talk you might think I’m world class or something. I’m not. I’m pretty good – definitely better than you – but way worse than any tournament player or something. I don’t write this because I’m good, I write it because I love the game. So here is my life in five crucial opponents.</p>

<h2>Dad</h2>

<p>Of course it begins with my dad, but it's not the first time I remember playing ping pong.<br>
I remember being dropped off at this game room type place that watches kids, and I asked a lady to play with me. I was very little, so she made sure I knew what I was getting into. A few uncoordinated minutes later and she hits me with “I thought you said you could play.” I wasn’t offended because obviously I couldn’t, but I was upset that she caught me in a lie.<br>
The next time I remember playing was when my dad taught me how to simply hit the ball over the net. Soon enough, it was instilled that my backhand was my bread and butter. No spin yet, no power, just consistency. Me and Papa would count the amount of shots we could rally to, once achieving five hundred. I had the basics down, and all was tranquil, and then before I knew it we played against each other.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember about this: how my dad would keep the score. When going on long streaks of swift victory, he wouldn’t even say my score out loud, only his.<br>
A fast crosscourt serve. “Seven.”<br>
A change-up down the line serve. “Eight.”<br>
It really stung when he did that. It made me feel like he was playing and I was just watching him play me. Before long I would try to return his cross court serves with a ferocious forehand, and more and more of my responses started going in. The games became more even, but he would still surely beat me. Sometimes I got really frustrated, trying dumb short serves or silly tactics to throw him off or cheat my way to a win. None of that worked.</p>

<p>Despite the tension there, now we could rally with our fast forehands. And you really felt like you were on to something with these forehands. Sometimes he would try this brutal bitch slap backhand to just wipe the ball off the court, but he never really got it. I took note of this.</p>

<p>Years passed and I got better and better and he did not. He was a great player: capable of taking advantage of kill opportunities, but a defensive specialist through and through. This was the tennis player he was too, but eventually table tennis separates itself from tennis. And before I knew it I was crushing it and he was just trying to return it. Sometimes successful, but usually not. And I was beating my dear father.<br>
And I worked hard on his bitch slap backhand. It is now my most used shot. I wish I had statistics for this, I’m sure 70% of my shots are bitch slap backhands. It is the expression of wanting the point to be over, despite anything, and it feels satisfying, to say the least.<br>
Table tennis shows me what words can do, which is not much. To say it feels satisfying is making a noise about so much more than a noise, which is how all of language is, I guess.</p>

<h2>Michael Harlow</h2>

<p>Never in my life have I thought to myself “what a soul on this guy” until him. If you met him you would think the same thing, I’m sure. He was the head of music at this outdoorsy Jewish camp I went to. His voice was loud. Beautiful, yes, but loud in the best way. Like he never needed a microphone. Like when he would sing and play his guitar it was everything he had, every time. And it probably wasn’t but it really felt that way if you saw him. You can just tell when someone is doing something they were meant to do, and that was just his thing. I guess right now mine is writing about table tennis.</p>

<p>Going to this new camp, meeting all these new people, it was very hard. The really athletic kids will always do well in a new place like this, just play a sport and everyone wants to be on their team. It doesn’t hurt that I was kind of a funny kid, and relatively nice, but what really helped was the table tennis. The table was outside in the middle of all the bunks, covered in dirt with a metal net. It was perfect.</p>

<p>I was 13 at this point and by far the best in my age group. Some kids were pretty good, but they didn’t get it. We made a tournament of 32 kids to play, and in the finals I agreed to play a best of seven with my friend Kian. I remember beating him easily, and him asking to call it a tie in the finals. He was one of these good-at-everything-since-birth kind of athletic kids that was so competitive because that mindset always paid off for him. Not this time. He wasn’t on my level, but I agreed we could call it a tie if I got to keep the tournament bracket paper. Today, I don’t know where that paper is.</p>

<p>Sometime after, Michael Harlow agreed to play me. Which is just such a great name, too. I wasn’t expecting much, considering he was kind of a big guy, and besides, what have I not seen in this game? I thought myself a veteran.<br>
The first thing I threw at him he let it fall almost to the ground before slashing sideways as hard as he could. The ball popped in the air and when it hit the table it went completely sideways to the bounce. I was dumbfounded. Once I figured out how to get those back, he would slam back my returns. He crushed me, and I was crushed. I mean I wasn’t really crushed, but I was made aware that I still have a lot of room to grow in this game.</p>

<p>Years passed and I went to many new places, fell in and out of love, and became a much better player. In my summer going into my sophomore year of college, I went back to this camp as a counselor. It was a really important summer to me, full of lifelong friendships and memories. But that really isn’t what this is about.<br>
When I showed up and saw the table in the staff break room, I knew what was up. Off the rip, I was wiping kids off the board, with many new tools in my arsenal. Another place was just another place to be the best at table tennis.<br>
One day I’m playing around with my friend, who I was kind of training, and who do I see but Michael Harlow. He looked like he never aged at all. He’s in the staff break room and I go over to him while he’s with his girlfriend.<br>
“Mr. Harlow.”<br>
He looks up at me from a beanbag.<br>
“You don’t remember me.”<br>
“No I don’t.”<br>
“Five years ago you beat me in table tennis. I request a rematch.”<br>
“Yeah sure man sounds good.”</p>

<p>And we play our rematch. And I’m genuinely nervous about this. It’s not every day you run into an old master you knew from when you were a mere sapling.<br>
We had a very close game, full of his fantastic spin and my flashy backhand. A small crowd is drawn. And he beats me.<br>
“Damn bro, you waited five years for this?”<br>
“Good game…”<br>
What’s left but a good game? It would’ve been so perfect to have beat him then, but I just never play people who play like him. A few more times I played him and I learned his strategies and defeated him once and for all, many times. But the thoughts of failure in that first crucial game were not put to rest. Me beating Michael also goaded new opponents.<br>
Kyle, my former bunk counselor from 6 years ago, also played.
</p>

<h2>Kyle</h2>

<p>I think his last name was Ramp?<br>
When I was a camper every counselor was some kind of hippie Jewish person (which is what I have become!), but not Kyle. I’m not even sure if this guy is Jewish. In fact, I don’t think he was and I don’t know why he worked there.<br>
Many nights we would hear scary stories about ghosts or triumphant ones about Israel. When it was Kyle's turn to wish us good night we got his life story. But now I feel bad, I don’t want to lay out this guy's business, so I’ll leave you with this: he told us that he went to Machu Picchu with his family and a hawk ripped out one of his testicles. And he has a scar on his ballsack that’s shaped like a question mark. To this day I don’t know if that was true.<br>
But anyways, I remember being a camper and really liking this guy. He was full of secrets and yet very authentic. He led the sports activity, and despite being awful at sports, me and him really got along. I was fast as hell but completely useless, dropping any pass thrown to me. And there was Kyle, unapologetically telling me I was awful.</p>

<p>Years later and I’m a counselor. And there this guy is and he’s got a football in his hands. We’re throwing it around and he tells me “I remember you were fast and couldn’t catch for shit.” In the years in between being a camper and a counselor I actually got very good at catching footballs. I would say better than any woman, at least.<br>
And of course, after beating Michael, I met him across the table table. And off the rip Kyle also beats me. Such an important summer to me. Two people who had a lot to teach me about the game. Kyle was an extremely interesting player. Hitting the ball with no spin, fast to my backhand as fast and with as much angle as he could. My backhand was my best shot, but he was relentless at this. Before long we did go back and forth with wins.<br>
And we had some really good games. We would go hard and get sweaty. I remember there was some kind of dance party happening outside the staff lounge. I missed it to play table tennis. I remember Ben, a dear friend, coming inside sweating about how great it was out there.<br>
Missing out wasn’t even a thought to me. I remember thinking “I hope they all had a great time,” as playing table tennis wasn’t even a decision. To call it obvious is like calling breathing obvious.<br>
And for many nights I’m wacking the ball with Kyle. After one I remember him sitting me down and explaining his long rivalry with Michael Harlow. I felt honored to get a glimpse at what they had. They had been going back and forth for years, apparently. After another night, I remember him admitting that I was really the better player, which never made sense to me because we really were pretty even on wins.<br>
I learned a lot that summer. I became a better player.</p>

<h2>My Ex-Girlfriend's Dad</h2>
<p>Its the summer going into my junior year of high school and I’m staying with my ex-girlfriend’s family on the west coast of Florida. It's a beautiful house right on the beach, and I actually remember having a lot of fun there. I remember watching movies and not comprehending anything.<br>
More importantly, I remember her father who was a D1 tennis player back in the day. And he was an insanely good tennis player, so you’d think that translates to being a good table tennis player. And you would be right.<br>
The house is held up on stilts for storm surges, and within the stilts was the table. The father was the only male in the family of five, so I felt a strange sense of bonding by doing stereotypical male activities with him. A kind of “wouldn’t it be nice to have a son” sort of thing. It’s weird and I don’t want to think about it anymore.<br>
But anyways we’re under the house and it starts to rain and I’m playing this man. He’s not very good, and I’m not even trying very much. I’m trying hard to not step on any masculine toes. The rain picks up and now it's storming over the ocean, creating a wall of water surrounding the stilts as rain runs down the walls of the house. After handedly beating him, he reveals to me that he is not left handed, and switches the paddle between his hands. Instantly, he is much better and this is truly some Princess Bride shit.<br>
The only problem is, though he was better using his dominant hand (and in fact a decent player) he was no match. I beat him every time, and I felt strange about it. It's a meaningless game, but was it really?<br>
This game was unforgettable, and he was a kind man.</p>

<h2>Ansh (and Vinay)</h2>
<p>This list would truly be incomplete without Ansh (and Vinay). When I showed up to college I was kind of a shell of myself. The start I had was pretty unfortunate, coming off an emotionally tumultuous couple of months. It was hard to focus on school for a while, which is hard when you’re just starting school. I was also pretty bad at interacting with people at first, which is also not great when you go to College.<br>
But in my orientation group was this guy Ansh. I was eager for any opponent, so I was just glad he wanted to play Table with me.<br>
He kept his backpack on during our first game, which was madness to me. It was a very close game and I can’t even remember who won. But our playstyles blended well together. I was just shocked he wouldn’t take his backpack off; when I play, I empty my pockets for the extra agility, and here was this guy who kept his whole backpack on, and still played extremely well.<br>
Over the next few years, he would become one of my most important friends, and what I can only call a training partner in table tennis. We greatly improved together, and went through many regimes of dominance over one another – constantly having to change our game to beat the other.</p>

<p>I remember one time we showed up to the table tennis club. It was a little open house thing for the club team, so we were intrigued. Then we learned that to play on the club team all you have to do is beat one of the sitting members in a match, which feels barbaric. I don’t know much about teams but they usually don’t work like that.<br>
So we played against their top guy, and his nipples were poking through his shirt, which was extremely distracting. His serve wiggled a bit in the air, but it was nothing crazy. When he played us it was clear he was in extreme control of the ball, and ultimately a much better player than me or Ansh. He also had a sidekick who I guess was the head of the “JV” team equivalent for this. He had table tennis shoes, which made me afraid of what this was to them.<br>
Me and Ansh left, and though we didn’t say it outloud, we knew their club was perverse. Nothing else could be said.</p>

<p>To this day we still play frequently when we should be doing our work. We’re still about evenly matched, but the game has greatly changed. Now we also play with Vinay, a close friend of ours who is also pretty evenly matched. Vinay has a two handed backhand, and it’s actually not bad.<br>
We go to the recreation center at our college where they have big white rooms where you can play table tennis in the void. Empty except for the sounds of the ball echoing through the thick air.</p>

<p>Note that this is called My Life in Five opponents, not “Five Memorable Opponents.” From an existentialist perspective, you are what you do. In a game like Table Tennis, what you do is explicitly defined by who you play, and what it’s like. This is my best attempt to communicate what that’s been like, and as a result, communicate a part of who I am. A part that I am proud of.</p>
