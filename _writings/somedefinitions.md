Some Definitions
</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">A crime</span></strong> is anything not permitted by the state. These include murder, torture, theft, and so much more! When the state believes you have committed a crime, you will know it is a crime because the most powerful entity in your world will collapse on you to inflict whatever the agreed upon punishment is.
</p>
<p>
	The idea of crime is as old as law, as for a rule is defined by its violation. A law you cannot theoretically violate is no law at all. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The enforcement of law</span></strong> is whatever action the state carries out to actualize its rules. This includes murder, torture, theft, and so much more! When the state is enforcing a law, you will know it is the enforcement of law because the most powerful entity in your world will collapse on you to enforce whatever the law is.
</p>
<p>
Law enforcement is as old as the state, and upholds the state. Committing a crime is only meaningful if you are punished for doing so by a body that is much larger than you. Otherwise, it is no law at all.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">A war crime</span></strong> is when a state takes actions against another state that the other states find unacceptable. This includes targeting non-combatants, torture, or the use of banned weapons. The idea of a war crime became much more prominent after WWII, where the world saw atrocities on a level never seen before, and many of the perpetrators were tried and convicted. 
</p>
<p>
You will know it is a war crime because it is called evil and wrong, and there will be suffering on an unimaginable scale. One example of a war crime is the Rape of Nanking, where hundreds of thousands of Chinese civillians were murdered and raped by Japanese soldiers. Many were tried.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Acts of war</span></strong> is when a state takes actions against another state that it finds necessary. This includes targeting non-combatants, torture, or the use of banned weapons. Acts of war are also as old as the state, as the state's existence depends on defending its control from the imposition of another state. 
</p>
<p>
You will know it is an act of war because it is called noble and necessary. One example of an act of war was the bombing of Hiroshima, where hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians were incinerated by an atomic blast, and tens of thousands more died slowly of radiation poisoning. Radiation poisoning entails internal bleeding, vomiting, and your skin melting off.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Genocide</span></strong> is the ultimate form of war crime. It is the deliberate attempt to destroy a whole national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. It happens through mass killings, forced starvation, and torture. This is commonly allowed using propaganda, which dehumanizes the victims and coerces the non-victim groups into complacency. 
</p>
<p>
The most famous example is the Holocaust<strong>,</strong> which killed and enslaved millions of people, many from my own family. You will know it is a genocide because there will be suffering at an unimaginable scale.
</p>
<p>
	
</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is no name</span></strong> for what the US does. There is no name because it is not talked about. It is not talked about because the populous is not coerced into complacency, but lulled into it by distraction. 
</p>
<p>
	One example is when the US dropped over 2.7 million tons of bombs on the country of Cambodia during the Vietnamese war. It is called the Vietnamese war, not the US war. This led to social collapse and the death of over 2 million people. 
</p>
<p>
	Another example is the destruction of Iraq, where cities were bombed and flattened and infrastructure was destroyed. The Iraqi death toll is estimated at well over half a million, with some studies reporting up to a million deaths from fire bombing, gunfire, or from the inability to survive without infrastructure. Many more were permanently disabled.
</p>
<p>
	Another example is the US funding and supporting Indonesia’s communist purge, killing up to one million civilians. The US also supported and silenced coverage on the Guatemalan genocide, killing 200,000. The US also supported the occupation of East Timor, which killed up to 200,000 (a quarter of the population). 
</p>
<p>
	You will not know this is happening, because you’d rather do something else than know.
</p>
<p>
	
</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hunger</span> </strong>is the most fundamental form of deprivation. 
</p>
<p>
	It is not some vague thing, but a slow annihilation of mind, body, and spirit. As days pass and with nothing to eat, the body begins to cannibalize itself. The stomach aches, the head throbs, and the mind decays. 
</p>
<p>
Once reserves run out, fat melts off the bone and muscles are stripped for the last scraps of fuel. The skin becomes gray, and wounds no longer heal. The heart slows, and soon, the immune system collapses. Hallucinations occur before your internal organs fail, and you surrender to darkness. 
</p>
<p>
Mothers watch their children wither. Fathers watch their family, the ones they are supposed to protect, become living skeletons. The need for food eclipses the fear of bullets or prison, and law becomes a suggestion. The starving masses realize their numbers, and the state collapses. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">A circus empire</span> </strong>is a system of political control in which the state maintains power not through direct censorship or propaganda, but by overwhelming the public with entertainment, trivial controversies, and constant distractions. The US is the first true circus empire and by far the most dominant empire the world has ever seen. There will soon be a McDonalds on North Sentinel Island.
</p>
<p>
	To belong to a circus empire is to accept any distraction that you are participating in the circus empire. It is to call it a democracy or a republic or whatever else you want to call it. It is to believe its definitions and its narratives.
</p>
<p>
	To belong to a circus empire is to be very fat, but not necessarily from food. It is to build a cocoon of sensations to protect yourself from feeling anything. It is to let them make you hungry for things you don’t need, and work hard to feed those needs.
</p>
<p>
	It is to spiritually abandon yourself, your loved ones, and other human beings to the fates decided by the empire. 
</p>
<p>
All that remains is the hunger to feel.
