My first project for Professor Gonnermann was to design experiments to determine how bubbles and liquid separate in liquid. Using some imaging techniques, we extracted the average luminosity of coffee at different \\( z \\) values (height in the column), at different times (shown below):

But we are not interested in the luminosity — we are interested in the *volume fraction of gas*, at every \\( z \\), at every \\( t \\).  
Here, *volume fraction of gas* means the percentage of the total volume at height \\( z \\) that is occupied by gas (i.e., not liquid).

We know:

- The **total volume fraction of gas** at a given time, denoted \\( a_0 \\), is a known value between 0 and 1.
- The **luminosity profile** at each time \\( t \\) is given as a normalized function  
  \\[
  \text{luminosity}(z) = L(z): [0, h] \to [0, 1]
  \\]  
  where \\( h \\) is the total height of the fluid column.

Can we find a function  
\\[
u(L): [0, 1] \to [0, 1]
\\]  
such that  
\\[
u(L(z)) = a(z)
\\]  
— that is, it maps observed luminosity at a height \\( z \\) to the corresponding gas volume fraction —  
with the constraint  
\\[
\frac{1}{h} \int_0^h u(L(z))\, dz = a_0 \quad \text{for all } t?
\\]

Take for granted:

- At \\( t = 0 \\), both luminosity and volume fraction are flat lines.  
- At \\( t = \infty \\), they become step functions.

An analytical solution **or** an algorithmic technique is accepted.
